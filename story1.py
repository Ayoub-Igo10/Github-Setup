# Dictionary basics :D

#1 - Define a dictionary call story1, it should have the following keys:
        # 'start', 'middle' and 'end'
story_1 = {
    "Start": "Once upton a time Batman found the villian",
    "middle": "He had a fight with the villian",
    "end": "He died to the villian"

}
print(story_1)
print(story_1)
print(type(story_1))
print(story_1.keys())
print(story_1.values())
print(story_1["Start"])
print(story_1["middle"])
print(story_1["end"])

story_1["hero"]= "Batman"
print(story_1)

#7 - Now let's add a new key:value pair.
    # 'hero': yourSuperHero
