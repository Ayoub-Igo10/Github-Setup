# Python intro
## Why Python
### Python use cases
#### Python set up with Pycharm
##### Python variables

- Env Testing `print("hello world")`

```python
# print("Good Morning, Please Enter your Name")
# name = input()# took user input & stored in the var called name
# print("Hello dear")
```
```python
# testing the env with print statement

# Python Variables?
# To store any data -
# To store user data - hard code the data - any other type
# first_name = "Angel" - String
# name = "Ayoub"

# UK_resident = yes or no - Boolean

# DOB = 99 - Integer
# travel = 15.4 Float
# salary = 40000 Integer
# gross_salary = "salary + travel"

first_name = "Ayoub"
last_name = "Igozouln"
Salary = 50
Travel = 3.5 # float

#print("Ayoub")
#print("first_name")
# Display the value of variable first_name
print(last_name)

#print(Salary)
print(Travel)

# How to find out the type of data stored in the var
# type(
print(type(last_name))

# # interact with users by taking user data in - input()
# print("Good Morning, Please Enter your Name")
# name = input()# took user input & stored in the var called name
# print("Hello dear")

# Get user first_name and last_name
# Display the names in the line
# User DOB
# course name
# UK_resident

print("What is your first name?")
first_name = input()
print("What is your last name?")
last_name = input()
print("What is your DOB?")
DOB = input()
print("What is your course name?")
course_name = input()
print("Are you a UK_resident?")
UK_resident = input()
```
